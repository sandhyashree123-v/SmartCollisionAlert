ðŸ§  SmartCollisionAlert â€“ Intelligent Real-Time Collision Detection System
SmartCollisionAlert is a computer vision-based system designed to detect vehicle collisions and accident-prone behavior in real-time using Digital Image Processing (DIP) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques. The system leverages Python, OpenCV, and NumPy to process live or recorded video feeds and identify threats such as nearby vehicle proximity, wrong-way driving, sudden braking, or erratic movement. Using background subtraction, motion tracking, contour detection, edge detection (e.g., Canny), and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, it flags potential danger zones and alerts the rider. The system is optimized for integration with smart helmet cameras, dashboard cameras, or road surveillance systems, offering a lightweight and modular solution for real-time traffic safety and rider awareness.
